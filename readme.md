# Playwright for Sauce Demo

Project is created to show the way how to handle the multiple users logged in and used in the same test iteratively.

## Required

The application isn't included in the repository, but it's available on https://www.saucedemo.com.

The project uses Node.js library and npm as a package manager.
The file `.env.example` contains all data required to run the tests.

## Installation

1. Make sure you've got Node.js installed
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npx playwright install` to install browsers
4. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
5. Run tests using one of the script included in the `package.json`

You can use `npx playwright test` to run tests headless or `npx playwright test --ui` to open the GUI.
When you open the GUI, please expand the projects section and select `setup`, `admin` and `app` project. 
There are 2 projects created with different viewport. You can use flag to run only one of the project: `--project=admin` or `--project=app`.<br>
If not used, both projects are executed.
